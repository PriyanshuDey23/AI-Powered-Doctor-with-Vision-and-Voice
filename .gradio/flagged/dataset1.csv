This type of fungal infection is usually caused by direct contact with an infected person, animal, or contaminated surface, and it typically responds well to over-the-counter antifungal creams or ointments, such as clotrimazole or terbinafine, applied directly to the affected area for several weeks.",,2025-01-31 01:57:45.463764
