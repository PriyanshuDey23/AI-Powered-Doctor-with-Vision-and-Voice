![](frontend.png)

## Overview
AI Doctor with Vision and Voice is an AI-powered medical assistant designed to analyze medical images, process patient speech, and generate professional medical responses. This project integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and multimodal AI analysis to provide insightful medical feedback.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition:** Converts patient speech into text using Google's Whisper model.
- **Image Analysis:** Processes medical images to detect potential conditions and provide insights.
- **AI-Powered Diagnosis:** Generates professional medical responses based on speech and image inputs.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts the AI doctor's response into a realistic voice output.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Gradio for an interactive experience.
